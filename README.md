# MONITOR3D
A simple interface to monitor and control your 3D printer

The software aims to monitor and control a printer remotely with a light, simple debugging, and user-friendly interface. 
For now, the software only works on Linux-based systems. Windows and Raspberry pi OS versions are comming.
(Also, this software is optimized for PRUSA printers. A few modifications to the serial_comm.py file might be needed depending on your printer, for the temperature display.)

## Quickstart
1) Install Docker and docker-compose according to the documentation (if not already installed).
2) Clone the Git repository.
3) Go to the "MONITOR3D" file in a terminal window.
4) Run the ```console docker-compose up ``` command.
5) Plug the 3D printer to a USB port.
6) Open the "index.html" file in a web browser

 

```console
$ 

```

### Requirements
